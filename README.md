The purpose of this Streamlit webapp is to make exploratory data analysis (EDA) much easier. By simply dragging and dropping or choosing a .csv file from the directory, basic information about the dataset can be learned.

### At a Glance

Firstly, the number of rows and columns are displayed alongside the number of categorical, quantitative, and boolean columns present within the dataset, which allows for a quick and easy understanding of what one has to work with. 

### Numerical Variables

By selecting "Numerical" from the dropdown menu and choosing a column name, a five number summary is displayed alongside a histogram with adjustable opacity, color, number of bins, and title names. Additionally, the graph can be downloaded for later use. 

### Categorical Variables

By selecting "Categorical" or "Boolean" from the same dropdown and choosing a column, a table with the proportions of each category will be displayed alongside a bar graph with adjustable opacity, bar color, edge colors, and title names. These graphs can also be downloaded for later use.
